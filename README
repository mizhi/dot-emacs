1. Introduction

This is my personal emacs setup. This should work on any platform with emacs
23.2+ installed. This is due to the inclusion of CEDET tools, in particular
Semantic. Emacs < 23.2 do not include it and the setup is not conducive to 
a github repository.

2. Additional Info

Make sure to run 

$ git submodule update --init 

to get all the additional submodules
